Hi Everyone - hopefully this will be a resource for you to be able to put your Tableau into the website portion of the final project: 

First, I'm making the assumtion that you have made a Tableau DASHBOARD 
  - A dashboard is an interactive interface that combines your different Tableau outputs
  
After you have made the dashboard, follow these steps to put the dashboard into your website
1. Make a Tableau Public Account: https://public.tableau.com

2. Extract your data within Tableau: 
      Data > [your data source] > Extract Data > Extract 
          ** Hint: you data source will likely be the name of your first table and then (BMGT402_DB_XXX)**

3. Publish the Dashboard to Tableau Public: 
      Server > Tableau Public > Save To Tableau Public As 

4. View your Tableau Dashboard on Tableau Public in your browser 

5. Find the share button at the bottom of the graphic [it has shperes connected with 2 lines] 

6. Copy the "Embedded Code" [you must copy all of this]

7. Input the embedded code into the tableauReport file, and create a new "Button" on the homepage for the file through the index.php file just as you modified them in lab

You should now see your dashboard on the website!
